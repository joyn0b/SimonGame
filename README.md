# SimonGame
This is a single page website where you can play the Simon Game.
Start by tapping on the background. Then a button will flash. Tap the same button to show you've seen it. 
It will take you to 'level 2'. A second button will flash. Remember the button which flashed first? Tap this button and the next button that flashed.
Each level will require you to remember the previous flashes. 
How many levels can you go up to?

Goodluck! 


P.S. I've adapted it from desktop-only view to a responsive view so it should work on any device you're using.
